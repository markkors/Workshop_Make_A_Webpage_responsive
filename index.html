          <p>Just the good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm.  Beats all you've ever saw, been in trouble with the law since the day  they was born. Straight'nin' the curve, flat'nin' the hills. Someday the  mountain might get 'em, but the law never will. Makin' their way, the  only way they know how, that's just a little bit more than the law will  allow. Just good ol' boys, wouldn't change if they could, fightin' the  system like a true modern day Robin Hood.</p>
          <p>Ulysses, Ulysses -  Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the  night. Ulysses, Ulysses - Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power,  and with all of his might. Ulysses - no-one else can do the things you  do. Ulysses - like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses - always  fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.</p>
          <p>Ten  years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court  for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a  maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.  Today, still  wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.  If you  have a problem and no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe  you can hire the A-team.</p>

        <h2>Special Information</h2>
        <p>I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It's true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it's only hay, hey hey. I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. 'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so fine. </p>

        <h2>Further Information</h2>
        <p>Children of the sun, see your time has just begun, searching for your ways, through adventures every day.</p>
